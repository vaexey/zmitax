# zmitax
A simple remote https to local http proxy that allows to open websites that are still using the obsolete TLSv1 (or similiar) protocol.
Applies modifications to every `text/html` response, allowing for easy visual enhancements to the websites.  
The default config for this proxy allows to connect to SUT ZMiTAC database web app which uses TLS v1 and is unavailable in modern browsers.

Example: http://localhost:5613/  

## Important notes
TLSv1 is considered obsolete and unsafe. 
Automated requests may be ignored, blocked or even cause legal trouble. 
Local proxy server if not put behind a firewall may be exploited for abuse.
